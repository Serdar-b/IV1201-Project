# Recruitment Application - IV1201

This project is a full-stack application with client-side rendering and a monolithic architecture.

## Project Structure

- **Frontend:** React (JavaScript)
- **Backend:** Express (Node.js)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL

## Getting Started

These instructions will guide you through getting a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You will need the following tools installed on your system:

- Node.js
- npm (Node Package Manager)
- PostgreSQL

### Running the Application

Step 1: Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Serdar-b/IV1201-Project.git
cd  IV1201-Project
```

Step 2: Change to the right directory

```bash
cd  IV1201-Project
```
#### Running the Backend 

Step 3: Navigate into `server` directorie:

```bash
cd  server
```

step 4: install all dependencies then run the server:

```bash
cd  npm install
npm run dev
```

step 5: 

```bash
cd  npm start
```

- Frontend
- Navigate to the client directory and start the React application:

```bash
cd IV1201-Project/client
npm install
npm start

```

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
